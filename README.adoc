== InfluxDB Monitoring Plugin

=== Purpose

This Hello World plugin can be used as a foundation for writing your (first) {hivemq-link}[HiveMQ] plugin. Although {hivemq-plugin-docs-archetype-link}[there is a Maven Archetype available] to generate your Hello World plugin right from the IDE, you can use this example project if you don't like to use the Archetype.

We strongly recommend to read the {hivemq-plugin-docs-link}[HiveMQ Plugin Documentation] to grasp the core concepts of HiveMQ plugin development.
